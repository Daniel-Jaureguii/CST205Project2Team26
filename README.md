# CST205Project2Team26
This project takes in any full size movie, and clips it down to any size that you reequest. It then stores the file to a location of your choosing, and it applies a black and white filter. We also added a GUI soundboard to our project. The soundboard plays different sounds over the movie. For example you can use a punch sound while there is a scene with people fighting. Throught the project we ran into some issues that changed what our final project outcome was. There was an internal error with the two libraries when executed together that caused the program to crash. However the program works if you split the two libraries and run them seperately.
